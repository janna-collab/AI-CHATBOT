# AI Chatbot Project

This AI Chatbot Project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the creation of robust and scalable web applications. The chatbot's core functionality is powered by the Hugging Face Inference API, which connects to the semi-free model Mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to generate dynamic, instruction-based responses. The project uses the requests library to make HTTP calls to the API, while JSON is used for both configuration (via a config.json file for securely storing the API key) and data exchange between the frontend and backend. The code is structured in a modular way, with clear separation between the view functions, configuration handling, and API integration logicâ€”making it an excellent project for beginners who want to learn about web development, API usage, and AI integration in a practical, hands-on environment.
